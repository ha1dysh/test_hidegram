-   3 files - main.html, main.css, main.js
-   Page unscrollable
-   Header and input stick to top and bottom of browser elements to make full page unscrollable
-   Yellow elements are scrollable and should fill the page
-   Make only the blocks
-   The solution should be adaptable to any device size and should keep the structure
-   Avoid JS as much as possible
-   The solution should be sent as an archive or posted on an own reachable hosting
